    <h1>Introduction to Fusion 360</h1>
    <p>Fusion 360 is a powerful computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software developed by Autodesk. It is widely used by designers, engineers, and manufacturers to create 3D models, simulate designs, and generate toolpaths for manufacturing.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Fusion 360</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrated Design Environment:</strong> Fusion 360 offers a seamless integration of CAD, CAM, and CAE tools in a single platform, allowing users to switch between design, simulation, and machining without the need for separate software.</li>
        <li><strong>Parametric Modeling:</strong> The software uses parametric modeling techniques, enabling designers to create and modify designs by defining parameters and constraints. This feature facilitates quick design iterations and changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Collaboration:</strong> Fusion 360 operates on a cloud-based platform, making it easy for teams to collaborate on projects in real-time. Multiple users can access and work on the same design simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> With built-in version control, Fusion 360 automatically saves different versions of a design, allowing users to track changes and revert to previous iterations if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Simulation and Analysis:</strong> Engineers can perform simulations and analyses to test the structural integrity, motion, and thermal properties of their designs, helping identify potential issues early in the development process.</li>
        <li><strong>CAM Toolpaths:</strong> Fusion 360 provides a wide range of CAM strategies to generate toolpaths for CNC machining. It supports 2.5 to 5-axis machining, making it suitable for various manufacturing processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started with Fusion 360</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Create an Autodesk Account:</strong> Visit the Autodesk website and create an account to access Fusion 360.</li>
        <li><strong>Download and Install:</strong> Download the Fusion 360 installer and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</li>
        <li><strong>Login and License:</strong> Launch Fusion 360, log in with your Autodesk account, and choose the appropriate license option (free trial, student/educational license, or commercial license).</li>
        <li><strong>Explore the Interface:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the user interface, including the Design, Model, and Manufacture workspaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Start Designing:</strong> Begin your design by sketching, creating 3D models, and applying constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Simulate and Analyze:</strong> Use the simulation tools to test your design's performance under different conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Generate Toolpaths:</strong> If required, switch to the Manufacture workspace to set up toolpaths for CNC machining.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Fusion 360 is a versatile tool that caters to both beginners and experienced professionals, making it a popular choice across various industries. With regular updates and an active user community, it continues to evolve and enhance its features for a seamless design and manufacturing experience.</p>
